Build a complete multi-page website called **GDev Studio** — a professional coding service studio by Indonesian IT student **Gadang Jatu Mahiswara** (Informatics Engineering, Fullstack Developer). Follow `gdev-studio-implementation-plan-v2.md` exactly. Tech stack: Next.js 14 App Router (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS + CSS Variables, shadcn/ui, GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Framer Motion, Lenis, `@magicui/animated-theme-toggler` (install via `npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/animated-theme-toggler`). All data (projects, services, testimonials) must live in `lib/data/*.ts` with the full `Project` interface specified in §4 — never hardcoded in JSX. All UI strings must use `lib/i18n/en.json` + `lib/i18n/id.json` with a `useTranslation` hook — the site is bilingual EN/ID with a pill toggle in the navbar that persists to `localStorage`. All colors via CSS variables in `globals.css` (no hardcoded hex anywhere). Logo: `logo-dark.png` in dark mode, `logo-light.png` in light mode, both from `/public/`. Images: use valid Unsplash URLs as placeholders. Gemini API key lives only in server-side `/api/chat/route.ts` (env: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, streaming response) — never exposed to client. No DB needed for this phase; deploy target is Vercel (API Routes become serverless functions automatically).

Implement all 7 pages as specified: `/` (Home — 12 sections in exact order: Navbar, Hero, Services, WhyUs, HowItWorks, TechStack, ProjectsBento, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, CTABanner, Footer), `/services` (expandable + magnetic cards), `/projects` (category filter + expandable + magnetic cards — note: "portfolio" is renamed to "projects" throughout), `/projects/[slug]` (detail page with parallax hero, challenge/solution sections, features list, gallery, and a checkout-style WA form that pre-fills WA message from form inputs), `/pricing` (5-tier comparison table + payment flow steps), `/about` (bio from `Resume_Gadang Jatu Mahiswara.pdf` — agent must read this PDF when provided; includes skills grid, timeline, values), and `/contact` (form → `/api/contact` → WA redirect). The floating action button (`FloatingFAB`) starts as a single combined button; on click it spring-splits into 2 separate buttons (WA + AI Chat) using Framer Motion `staggerChildren`. The Projects section on Home uses the 21st.dev interactive hover links component (`npx shadcn@latest add https://21st.dev/r/hurerag24/interactive-hover-links`). Services and Projects cards use expandable card pattern (Framer Motion `layout` animation for height) combined with GSAP magnetic effect (x/y translate ±20px within 80px radius). All CTA buttons use GSAP hover (scale + skewX) and click (press scale 0.95) interactions.

Strictly follow the 12 global rules in §10: animate only `transform` and `opacity`; no emoji anywhere (Lucide/Phosphor only); no hardcoded hex; GSAP for scroll-triggered reveals + complex sequences + button interactions, Framer Motion for component micro-interactions + layout animations + page transitions — never duplicate roles; Lenis initialized at root `layout.tsx`; GSAP ScrollTrigger `once: true` + `markers: false` in production; mobile-first with `md` and `lg` breakpoints. Animation responsibilities per component are defined in the table in §7 — follow it exactly. Visual reference is `creatiwise-reference.jpg`: clean white/black contrast, sticky navbar with logo left + nav center + actions right, tilt process cards (HowItWorks), bento grid for projects, dark CTA section, minimal footer. When the user provides `Resume_Gadang Jatu Mahiswara.pdf`, read it to populate the `/about` page with real data. When the user provides the Gemini API key, insert it as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` and wire it to `/api/chat/route.ts`.
